You are provided with a brag document that summarizes my contributions through PRs I've authored and reviewed. Please create a compelling self-reflection document that maps these contributions to my organization's performance review criteria.

Here is the brag document content (please reference specific PRs in your analysis):

Here are the performance review criteria for my role:
{performance_criteria}

For your self-reflection document, please:
1. Start with a specific introduction about my impact during this period.
2. Create separate sections for each major project or area of work.
   - For each section, highlight the most significant PRs from the brag doc that demonstrate exceptional impact.
   - Map each PR to a specific performance criterion.
   - For each PR, explain:
       * What technical or business challenge I solved
       * How I approached the solution
       * Why this demonstrates the specific skill or responsibility
       * The quantifiable or qualitative impact this work had
   - Use direct quotes from the brag doc where appropriate
3. Include a section on mentorship, collaboration, or leadership if relevant.
4. Include a section highlighting how I exceeded expectations or went beyond basic requirements.
5. End with a forward-looking conclusion summarizing my growth and future goals.

IMPORTANT:
- Be specific, not genericâ€”reference precise PRs and their outcomes
- Use concrete examples from the brag doc
- Show how each contribution demonstrates a specific performance criterion
- Make this compelling and impressive
- Include PR links (using markdown format) when referencing specific PRs
- Structure should be clear with headers for each section and subsection
- Format the document in markdown with clear headers, bullet points, and links to PRs where appropriate.
